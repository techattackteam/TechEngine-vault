## Now

| | |
|---|---|
| **Quarter** | 2026 Q3 (Jul–Sep) |
| **Sprint** | [[2026-08 Sprint 05 — M3 Project & M4 Window]] *(Aug 29 to Sep 11 — the boundary was pulled **one week early**)* |
| **Sprint goal** | **Ship M3 and open the window: `projects/dev/` loads through a real `project.toml`, and a triangle draws on the render thread.** M3 is the commitment; M4 is the reach, and it is the half at risk. |
| **Current focus** | S5-P4 and S5-T7 closed Sep 6 (#75, #76). Stories F, B and E are complete. Session finished; next is S5-T8's drawing loop and mailbox, with T9 optional. |
| **Top blocker** | No blocker for T8. Window/context startup is verified in CI; drawing, resize presentation and the triangle proof remain. Preserve the cut order if capacity tightens. |
| **Next milestone** | M3 editor testbed shipped (#71), with its default-path fix merged (#73); runtime packaging is deferred to M6. M4 is the remaining stretch this sprint. |
| **Direction** | Fresh start ([[ADR-004 — Fresh start (v2) with v1 as reference]]); v1 = reference prototype |
| **Reconciled against** | engine `01ed7a30` (2026-08-30) |

**Reading that stamp** ([[ADR-012 — Vault repository split]] §6): the vault is its own repo,
so its HEAD and the engine's move independently and a design note can describe code that has
moved on. The stamp is the last engine commit a drift check **actually ran against** — advanced
by `/weekly-review` or `/sprint-plan` only as that check's output, never as a formality.

```bash
git log --oneline 01ed7a30..origin/master
```

**Anything it lists is unreviewed against the vault** → treat design notes as *suspect* and say
so when grounding an answer (CLAUDE.md rule 2). Distance is a signal, not proof: it cannot tell
you *which* note drifted, only that nobody has looked.

**Latest check: 2026-09-05**, against local HEAD and cached `origin/master` at `934cf999`.
The Project/App/FileAccess spot-check confirmed unresolved drift, including the const
mutators contradicting the read-only claim and ADR-017 lifecycle differences.
See [[2026-09-05 Weekly Review]] for scope, evidence and remaining editorial fixes.

**Stamp unchanged:** reconciliation is deferred and the check did not cover every touched
system. The last advance remains Aug 30 at `01ed7a30`; no remote fetch, build, demo or live
CI verification ran today. Known Tracy-version drift remains on [[Backlog]].
## 🗓️ Rhythm

> **The one home for cadence.** Sprint length, ceremony timing, the weekday fallback and the
> weekly rhythm table live here. Everything else links to this section instead of restating
> it, so there is one place to change when the cadence moves again.

**Sprints: 2 weeks**, one headline goal (**changed from 4 on 2026-08-20**). A sprint **week
runs Sat → Fri**, so a sprint starts on a **Saturday** and ends on the **Friday** 2 weeks
later. Every sprint therefore contains **2 weekends**: the boundary weekend (`/sprint-plan` —
demo + retro + next-sprint planning) followed by **1 weekly review** (`/weekly-review`).
Counting them is the cheapest way to tell where you are in a sprint.

**Why it changed.** Two sprints in a row closed early with the calendar still running.
Sprint 02 met its goal in 6 days of a 5-week box; Sprint 03 closed **8 days early**, with
13 of its 17 cards done in the first 9 days. The last stretch of a 4-week sprint had no
plan in it, so the board sat empty and momentum stopped. A 2-week box makes the plan and
the calendar end together. Sizing does not change: the box shrank to match the observed
close rate, not to demand more per day.

**`/sprint-plan` absorbs `/weekly-review` on a boundary weekend — never run both**
(2026-07-26). The retro covers the final week, and it inherits the weekly review's
stale-artifact + hub-drift check. Running both wrote two journal entries and updated this
Dashboard twice before any code got written.
→ **Next ceremony:** **weekend of Sep 12–13, 2026**: `$sprint-plan`, the Sprint 05 → 06
boundary. It absorbs the final-week review. The Sep 5 mid-sprint checkpoint is recorded in
[[2026-09-05 Weekly Review]].
*(Sprint 04's boundary ran Sun Aug 30, a week ahead of its published Sep 5-6, because the sprint
met its goal on day 9 with an empty board. See [[2026-08-30 Sprint 04 Retrospective]].)*

**An early close moves the boundary, not the cadence.** A sprint that meets its goal with time
to spare is re-planned at the next weekend, and the new sprint's 2-week range is set from that
Saturday. Sprint 02 → 03 happened to land the boundary back on its published date; Sprint 03 → 04
moved it from Aug 29-30 to Aug 22-23; Sprint 04 → 05 moved it again, to **Aug 29-30**. Do not
assume it holds either way.

**An early close costs a weekend, and that cost is not free.** Sprint 05 was pulled forward on
Sun Aug 30, so its first weekend was already spent on the review and the planning session. It
therefore contains **one** weekend deep day rather than two, and its capacity is **6-7 🟢**
rather than 8-10. Price that into the sizing rather than discovering it in week 2.

**Ceremony anchor = the weekend, not a fixed day.** Run each on whichever weekend day you
work; if you work both, pick one.

**Weekday fallback, if the weekend is lost (2026-08-20).** A ceremony that cannot run on its
weekend runs on the **next Mon or Thu evening** instead, time-boxed to about 45 minutes, and
the rest of that evening stays build time. It does not roll forward to the following weekend.
Driver: two weekends vanished in August, the reviews rolled instead of falling back, and the
board stayed empty for 10 days because nothing refilled it. Weekday evenings have been the
more reliable slot all along — a 2-week sprint has only one spare weekend, so it cannot
absorb a lost one.

**The boundary weekend is day 1 of the new sprint, and stays a dev day.** Because the week
starts Saturday, both weekend days already fall inside the new sprint — so the Sat/Sun swap
never moves the boundary. Time-box the ceremonies and spend the rest of the day on code; the
artifact gate and a groomed [[Backlog]] are what keep planning short.

**Sprints no longer track calendar months** (2 weeks ≠ 1 month → 26/yr, and the boundary
walks backwards through the calendar). Don't derive dates from the month — the sprint note's
own date range is the source of truth. Adopted 2026-07-26. Sprint 02 was a 5-week one-off
transition, Sprint 03 the first clean 4-week cycle, and **Sprint 04 is the first 2-week one**.

**Weekly rhythm** — energy is *planned*, not aspirational; protect the light/off days.

| Day | Mode        | Typical work                                             | Capacity   |
| --- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Mon | 🟢 Deep     | Implementation (core loop)                               | ~1 🟢      |
| Tue | 🟡 Light    | Docs, reading, small fixes, ADR drafting                 | 1 🟡       |
| Wed | ⚪ Relaxed   | Recovery — optional light planning, else rest            | 0          |
| Thu | 🟢 Deep     | Implementation                                           | ~1 🟢      |
| Fri | 🟠 Moderate | Lighter implementation — finish/refactor, prep next week | 1 🟠       |
| Sat | 🔴 Off*     | Karting — no engine work                                 | 0          |
| Sun | 🟢 Deep*    | Implementation + weekly review                           | **2–3 🟢** |

**Weekday deep ≠ weekend deep.** Mon/Thu are *after the day job* — one evening block, one
🟢 task. The weekend deep day is a **full day**: size it for **2–3 🟢**, not one. Sizing a
sprint by counting "deep days" without this split under-fills it by ~1 task/week.

*Weekend days are a **pair**, not fixed: default Sat off / Sun deep, but swap them or use
both when there's no karting. Guardrail: keep **≥1 rest day most weekends** — Mon–Fri
already carries 2 deep days.

## 🧭 Plan

Phase 1–3 compressed into Jul 19–26 (audit → plan → ground), each gating the next.
Build order from here: the [[Roadmap]] ladder — **chain M0–M6, then lanes**.

| # | Phase | What | State |
|---|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | **Deep v1 audit** | Read (not skim) each subsystem → deepen [[v1 Code Audit]] | ✅ done (Jul 19) |
| 2 | **Plan v2 + set up AI** | Foundation ADRs 005–008 · AI agents + ceremony loop | ✅ done |
| 3 | **Ground** | Git flow · build scaffold green on CI · `master` ruleset Active | ✅ done (Jul 24) |
| 4 | **Base foundation** | Logger · Assert · Clock · headless fixed-timestep loop — [[2026-08 Sprint 02 — Base Foundation]] | ✅ goal met (Jul 30); sprint closed Aug 2 |
| 5 | **Climb the ladder** | Chain M1–M6 (enablers · concurrency + serialization · project + testbed · window · Scene & scheduling · content), then the lanes — [[Roadmap]] | ✅ **M1 done** (Aug 20) · ✅ **M2 done** (Aug 30) → 🔨 **M3 + M4 together** in [[2026-08 Sprint 05 — M3 Project & M4 Window]]; M5 needs the task-graph ADR |

## Active decisions

Recently locked — full set in [[ADR Index]]:
- [x] **Profiler** ([[ADR-013 — Profiler (Tracy-backed instrumentation)]]) + **Events/`StringId`** ([[ADR-014 — Events (buffered streams) & StringId]]) — **both Accepted 2026-08-02**, both M1 gates closed, and M2's threading ADR is unblocked
- [x] **Threading** ([[ADR-015 — Threading (sim on main, render thread owns GL)]]) + **Serialization** ([[ADR-016 — Serialization (binary primitives & describe-once seam)]]) — **both Accepted 2026-08-22**, both M2 gates closed on day 1. ADR-015 §3 amended 2026-08-24: the pool ships four workers, not one
- [x] **Bootstrapping** ([[ADR-017 — Bootstrapping (editor manifest, fixed runtime layout)]]) —
  **Accepted 2026-08-31**, written mid-sprint out of S5-D1 against an artifact gate that had
  said no ADR was owed. `project.toml` is **editor-only**; the runtime mounts a fixed layout and
  reads no manifest; `app` owns the lifecycle through an `App` base class every executable
  subclasses. **Partially supersedes [[ADR-006 — v2 core architecture & module layout]] §1**'s
  "editor out of the frame loop" clause. It cut **Story F** into Sprint 05 and rewrote three
  Story B cards, which is where the 🟠 overload came from. **Two clauses of § *Decision* 3 did
  not ship as written:** all four virtuals are pure, and `main()` stayed per-exe behind a
  `runApp<>()` template. Both are logged and neither is amended yet ([[Backlog]])
- [x] **Autonomous lane:** S5-P1, P2 and P3 are closed. The first code PR (#66) merged
  Sep 3; [[Sprint Board]] records Linux validation and the one-PR-per-day observation.
  [[Autonomous Lane — Design]] now requires completed cards to move to Done and human
  follow-up to Review/Demo. The live scheduler was not inspected during this review.
- [ ] task-graph · renderer · netcode transport · scripting SDK · game UI → owed ADRs, each gating a rung ([[Roadmap]])
- [x] **How long is a sprint?** **2 weeks, decided 2026-08-20** — § *Rhythm*. Two sprints in
  a row closed with the calendar still running, and the unplanned tail is where momentum died.
- [x] **What happens when a ceremony's weekend is lost?** **Weekday fallback, 2026-08-20** —
  it runs the next Mon or Thu evening, time-boxed, and does not roll to the next weekend.
- [x] **Can an Accepted ADR be amended in place?** **Yes — resolved 2026-08-20 (S3-P1)**,
  [[ADR Index]] § *Amending an Accepted ADR*. The gate is how much argument the change needs,
  not whether a decision moved; the headline decision in a title is never amendable.

## Health check (2026-09-05)

- **Delivery:** M3's editor half and both design gates are complete. S5-B1 closed Sep 5 (#73);
  M4 is a stretch. The checkpoint's automatic cut does not trigger because F and B closed.
- **Build:** unverified this session. Local history records 11 merges Aug 31–Sep 4;
  no builds, tests, demos or live CI checks ran. Prior validation is recorded on [[Sprint Board]].
- **Sustainability:** Miguel reports good energy and room for more programming. Recalibrate
  light/moderate estimates in both directions before increasing scope; S5-T2 and S5-T1 are
  the concrete examples. Specific rest days and job/karting balance were not reported.
- **Artifact health:** needs reconciliation. [[2026-09-05 Weekly Review]] records the
  confirmed differences and check limits; the reconciliation stamp has not advanced.
